# NoxCoin Project  v0.5.1.3

## NoxCoin – Private. Secure. Untraceable.

### ?? Note from the Maintainer
Hello!  
This is a community revival of **NoxCoin** — all previous threats have been deleted and purged.  
Please verify everything independently and use only trusted sources.  

My goal is simple: to help this coin survive and grow into a secure, community-driven project.  
I'm not an official developer — this project is open to everyone who wishes to help.

##  About NoxCoin
**NoxCoin** is a fork of **Monero**, the most battle-tested privacy cryptocurrency — rebuilt with a community-first vision.  
It retains Monero’s strong cryptographic foundation while introducing new emission rules, scaling adjustments, and decentralization incentives.

## Compiling NoxCoin from source

### Dependencies

The following table summarizes the tools and libraries required to build. A
few of the libraries are also included in this repository (marked as
"Vendored"). By default, the build uses the library installed on the system
and ignores the vendored sources. However, if no library is found installed on
the system, then the vendored source will be built and used. The vendored
sources are also used for statically-linked builds because distribution
packages often include only shared library binaries (`.so`) but not static
library archives (`.a`).

[1] On Debian/Ubuntu `libgtest-dev` only includes sources and headers. You must
build the library binary manually. This can be done with the following command `sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev && cd /usr/src/gtest && sudo cmake . && sudo make`
then:

- on Debian:
  `sudo mv libg* /usr/lib/`
- on Ubuntu:
  `sudo mv lib/libg* /usr/lib/`

[2] libnorm-dev is needed if your zmq library was built with libnorm, and not needed otherwise
